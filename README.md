## I. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an electronics retail business, specifically centered around phone and accessory transactions. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data that can help improve sales strategies, understand customer preferences, and enhance product offerings.

## II. Dataset
The analysis is based on two datasets:

ðŸ“‚ Phone_Sales: Contains transactions with detailed information about phone purchases, including customer demographics (gender, age range), product specifications (brand, color, carrier), payment method, and geographic location.

ðŸ“‚ Accessories_Sales: Includes records of accessory purchases, capturing product type, subcategory, and sales information. It links customer codes and transaction IDs with unit prices and sales values.

## III. Main Process
The project followed a structured data analysis process:
* Data Extraction: Data was extracted from Excel sheets into structured tables.
* Data Cleaning: Null values and inconsistencies (e.g., missing bank names) were reviewed.
* Data Exploration: Key fields such as unit price, product brand, customer demographics, and geographic area were examined.
* Data Insights: Patterns in sales performance, product preference, and customer segments were identified using SQL queries.
